# Human Centered Design 2022/2023



## Introduction

Human Centered Design is all about creating interfaces and design for real humans. In the case of this course, we will design specifically for a single person and their needs.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to apply design principles in design and interfaces.
- Understand user needs and apply them in design.
- Learn to test and use the results to improve your design.

## Assignment

**Design with and for real people**

During this course I will create an interface exclusively for one person. Every week I will test this interface with the person and improve it based on the feedback I get. At the end of this course I will have a fully functional interface that is designed for one person.

It is important to keep in mind who this person is, what their needs are and what they want to achieve. This will be the basis for the design of the interface.

I will be making an interface for Eric Groot Kormelink. Eric is a designer that focuses on accessibility and inclusively. Eric moves himself around in an electric wheelchair and doesn't possess fine motor skills. 

Eric is looking for an interface solution for conveying emotion and body language in chat rooms. He feels that simple emoji's are not enough for his needs.

### Criteria

- Design multiple interfaces, versions and prototypes for the assignment. Experiment with different forms of interactions and design. What works well and what doesn't?
- Describe your test person in a User Scenario.
- Test your ideas and interfaces three times with the test person. Improve your design based on the feedback you get and document it well.
- Explain exclusive design principles and how you applied them in your design.
- Write a Readme with a conclusion that describes the learning objectives and criteria and how you applied them in your design.
