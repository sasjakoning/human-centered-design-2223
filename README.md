# Human Centered Design 2022/2023



## Introduction

Human Centered Design is all about creating interfaces and design for real humans. In the case of this course, we will design specifically for a single person and their needs.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to apply design principles in design and interfaces.
- Understand user needs and apply them in design.
- Learn to test and use the results to improve your design.

## Assignment

**Design with and for real people**

During this course I will create an interface exclusively for one person. Every week I will test this interface with the person and improve it based on the feedback I get. At the end of this course I will have a fully functional interface that is designed for one person.

It is important to keep in mind who this person is, what their needs are and what they want to achieve. This will be the basis for the design of the interface.

I will be making an interface for Eric Groot Kormelink. Eric is a designer that focuses on accessibility and inclusively. Eric moves himself around in an electric wheelchair and doesn't possess fine motor skills. 

Eric is looking for an interface solution for conveying emotion and body language in chat rooms. He feels that simple emoji's are not enough for his needs.

### Criteria

- Design multiple interfaces, versions and prototypes for the assignment. Experiment with different forms of interactions and design. What works well and what doesn't?
- Describe your test person in a User Scenario.
- Test your ideas and interfaces three times with the test person. Improve your design based on the feedback you get and document it well.
- Explain exclusive design principles and how you applied them in your design.
- Write a Readme with a conclusion that describes the learning objectives and criteria and how you applied them in your design.

## User scenario

To get a better view op the user I created a user scenario. This scenario is based on the information I got from Eric and my own observations.

<!-- Use structure of Who? What? How? and Why? -->

"Eric is a 50 year old man working in the field of accessibility and inclusivity. From birth he's had a defect that caused a halt in his muscle development. Due to this his fine motor skills have been limited and he has to use an electric wheelchair to move around. Eric lives in Amsterdam in a focus group home. 

Eric uses his phone in a different way than most people. He is able to navigate his phone using his fingers, however, in many cases his hand will be obstructing the screen. For this reason he generally uses a small (universal) stylus. The stylus is small enough to fit in his pocket and he can use it to navigate his phone.

Eric wants to be able to convey his emotions and body language in chat rooms. He feels that simple emoji's are not enough for his needs. He'd like to do this in a way that is easy for him to do. Which means it should be doable with one hand and optionally with a stylus."

<p>On Thursday 20-04-2023 my assigned group held a test session with Eric. We tested a couple of prototypes and got some valuable feedback. 
</p>

<br>

<h3>Info about Eric</h3>

<p>Eric is a 50 year old man working in the field of accessibility and inclusivity. From birth he's had a defect that caused a halt in his muscle development. Due to this his fine motor skills have been limited and he has to use an electric wheelchair to move around.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Zero ground</h3>

<p>Before we showed Eric our prototypes we wanted to make sure we were on the same page. We asked him to show us how he generally uses his phone and how he chats with other people. There were some interesting things we learned from this.
</p>

<p>He is able to navigate his phone using his fingers, however, in many cases his hand will be obstructing the screen. For this reason he generally uses a small (universal) stylus. The stylus is small enough to fit in his pocket and he can use it to navigate his phone. Using his stylus he's also able to type using the regular mobile keyboard.
</p>

<p>What was also interesting is that he uses gestures to navigate his (android) phone. This way he can use simple swipes from the sides and bottom of the screen to navigate.

He uses both IOS and Android phones.

It also turned out he's not able to use multi-touch gestures like pinch zooming on an image very well.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Chat preferences</h3>

<p>While chatting he's able to type relatively fast. He generally uses his stylus which means he only uses one hand to type. He sometimes uses emoji's while chatting but these are only a select few like a winky face of hearts. He feels that there are too many emoji's to choose from which confuses him when trying to find the right emoji to convey his emotions. He wishes to use a better way of conveying his emotions and body language. He also wants to be careful using certain emoji's because the way they can be interpreted can be very different from person to person.
</p>

<p>Currently his preference lies with using visual emoji's but in the past he has used a lot of text based emoji's.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Home situation</h3>

<p>At home Eric generally uses a desktop using a normal mouse and keyboard. He does however mostly type with one hand.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>

<p>Pretty early on during the test session we discovered that it's difficult for Eric to take pictures on this phone. He generally lays his phone down on a table and it takes quite some effort to lift his phone and position it to take a picture of his face.

He seemed to be quite interested in using certain characters to portray emotions, for example Snapchat bitmoji. 
</p>

<br>

<h3>Future plans</h3>

<p>For the next test session I'm looking into creating a neutral emoji which can be adjusted using sliders. For example a slider for the expression of eyes, mouth, eyebrows, etc. This way Eric can create his own emoji's and use them in his chats.

<p> 
    Originally the second test session was to be held the 26th of April. But due to Eric being sick we had to postpone it to the 10th of May.
</p>

<br>

<h3>New prototype</h3>

<p>Based on the feedback I received from the first test session I created a new prototype. This prototype was a web app that allowed Eric to create his own emoji's. The emoji's were created using sliders that allowed him to adjust the expression of the mouth and eyebrows. This way he could make an emoji that expressed his emotions exactly the way he wanted.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Test session</h3>

<p>To start of the session I explained to Eric what the context and situation of the test was. I asked him to imagine he's chatting casually on Whatsapp and he wants to send an emoji to convey his emotions.
</p>

<p>With those instructions I let Eric try out the prototype. He first used the chat to send a message normally. After that he pressed the emoji button and was presented with a screen where he could create his own emoji. He was able to adjust the sliders and create an emoji that he liked. After that he was able to send the emoji to the chat.
</p>

<p>He also tried to type a message and add an emoji to the same message. This was, however, not yet implemented in the prototype.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Session results</h3>

<p>Eric was quite positive about the prototype. He liked the idea of being able to create his own emoji's and he immediately understood how to how to use the sliders and he was happy with the sizing of the elements. He could use the prototype well with his fingers as well as a stylus. 
</p>

<p>The only issue he came across when using a stylus was that when he clicked and dragged a slider, the phone would slide over the table. This isn't an issue on his personal phone though, because he has a case that prevents this. This problem can also be avoided by clicking spots on the slider instead of dragging it.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Suggested edits</h3>

<p>After playing around with the prototype, Eric has a couple of suggestions for edits. At the moment, the only edits Eric could do to the emoji were the eyebrows and mouth. This sets a limit to the amount of emotion he can convey. He suggested adding more sliders to the prototype. For example, a slider for the eyes, cheeks, etc. But he also warned that adding too many settings could make it confusing to use and defeat the purpose of the prototype.
</p>

<p>My suggestion was to add a few pre-set default emotions (angry, shocked, happy etc) that he could select and then edit. This would add more options to convey emotion without making the prototype too complicated.
</p>

<p>Eric also suggested to add a way to change the color of the emoji. This way he could convey clearer emotion like green for disgust.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Future plans</h3>

<p>Based on the results on this session I will be making a new prototype. This prototype will have a couple of pre-set emotions that can be selected and edited. It will also have a color picker to change the color of the emoji. Along with that I will look into a way to add the emoji to a message.

## Exclusive design principles

**Study situation**

To design effectively for Eric, I needed to deeply understand his specific situation and needs. By studying his abilities, the devices he uses, and his preferences, I could create an interface tailored to him. I observed Eric using his phone and learned about his habits, like using a small stylus and gestures for navigation. This principle guided me to focus on his unique situation and design an interface that suits his needs.

<br>

**Ignore conventions**

While consistency is usually valued in design, it may not always be suitable for users with special needs. In Eric's case, sticking to traditional design patterns might not be the best approach. Instead, I chose to disregard certain conventions that might not work well for him, based on observations and feedback from test sessions. This allowed me to explore alternative solutions that better fit Eric's habits and preferences.

<br>

**Prioritise identity**

Inclusive design often emphasizes prioritizing content and essential tasks, but when designing exclusively for an individual, it's important to prioritize their identity. For Eric, expressing emotions and body language in chat rooms was important. So, I focused on developing features that allowed him to express himself. By giving priority to his identity, I aimed to create an interface that truly represents Eric and meets his specific needs, enabling effective communication in chat interactions.

<br>

**Add nonsense**

This principle, not flipped from the original inclusive design principles, is an additional concept I used in my prototype. "Adding nonsense" means incorporating unconventional or unexpected elements into the design. In Eric's case, traditional emoji options weren't enough for his needs, so I explored alternative ways to convey emotions. By introducing the idea of creating customized emoji using sliders, I added creativity and personalization to the interface. This allowed Eric to go beyond standard emoji and express himself more accurately.
